# Chat_Bot_using_CNN
This project exploits a deep learning algorithm called Convolution Neural Networks. The main advantage of CNN over Conventional Neural
 Networks is they can learn/capture relevant features from data, this is how human brain works at different levels. This is called
 Feature Learning. For new tasks/problems CNNs are particularly good at feature extraction. Compared to other Neural Networks, CNNs exploit
 Pre-training technique which saves us time and memory.

 The methods used for manipulating the parameters are as follows:
 Tokenization
 Lemmatization
 Removing punctuations
 Pickle dumping

In business, Chatbots are used to give quick replies, thereby customer is satisfied. Why not extend this feature to all the categories?
Chatbots can be used in education sector for student and staff help. This project is a manifestation of such a bot. With chatbots,
we can implement a cost saving strategy, since chatbots never get bored, they do not need to work in shifts like humans.

APPLICATION AREAS OF THE PROJECT
Chatbots can be used in customer support, 24x7.
Chatbots can be used to personalize news for user.
Chatbots can be used in ordering food and book flights.
Remember Interstellar? Romilly lived 23 years on Endurance with CASE! With extensive research we can create such chatbot-type
 software for human companionship.
Chatbots can be use in various sectors such as Hospitality, Healthcare, Legal advice, and Education.
